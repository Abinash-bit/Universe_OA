&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Brief
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone this is Sri Guru Datta P.(pupperemeritus). I am extremely excited to get started with my GSoC journey. It has been a dream come true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the progress in these weeks has been done on the fronts of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-adjusting the proposed schedule : Re-evaluating and taking a closer look at requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering more information required to implement : Been provided reference implementation in MATLAB by Dr. Jeff Scargle himself. And validating the plan and research done during the period of creating the project proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had weekly meets to break the ice and communicate more directly through weekly meets with mentors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Environment setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already completed my environment setup earlier in order to make pull requests to stingray. I just followed the documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.stingray.science/install.html"&gt;https://docs.stingray.science/install.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Codebase familiarity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had a bit of familiarity with powerspectrum, crossspectrum and bexvar modules as I had worked on various pull requests on them. My mentor advised me to look into multitaper, which I did. It gave me a few ideas on how I could implement this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Coding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already started a few days early and went ahead and implemented the Lomb-Scargle Fourier Transform which will be the backbone of the power spectrum and cross spectrum. 2 days into the coding period and I also have started coding up the wrapper classes. It turns out to be a very tangled process in order to get every small nook and cranny of the class to work. But I have seemed to get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/06/20230601_0311_pupperemeritus/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 02:11:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Blog Zero</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230506_2149_pupperemeritus/</link><dc:creator>pupper emeritus</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a test post to check the status of the blog and RSS feed.
