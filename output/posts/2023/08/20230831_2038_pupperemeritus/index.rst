    <p>I am reaching the final stages of my project well ahead of the schedule.</p>
    
    <p>Both the Crosspectrum and Powerspectrum classes, the Lomb Scargle Fourier Transform and Basic Documentation have been completed. Tests are almost done too</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    
    <p>I have double checked with Matteo that the results are consistent using multiple examples and they are close to expected results.</p>
    
    <p>The following are the documentation notebooks on how to use the classes.</p>
