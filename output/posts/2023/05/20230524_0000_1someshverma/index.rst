    <p>I  chose OpenAstronomy as i have interest in astronomy right from my childhood and RADIS also aline with my interst and skills .I have also contributed to Libre Health App for Baby Care but then i shifted my focus  only to RADIS . By the end i had four merged pull request and I was working on the fifth issue.</p>
    
    <h3 id="contriutions-and-experience">Contriutions and Experience</h3>
    <p>I started to contribute to RADIS from January’23 , initially i faced problem to set up the things and run the code . After one weel or so I fixed the issues and than I spent one week on understanding the codebase ,reading documentation and try examples. By now , i had developed a rough understanding of the code .</p>
    
    <p>Then , I started to find issue over which i can work and started to work on the issues ,mentors have been quite helpful so far, whenever i got struck somewhere ,they helped in resolving the issue .</p>
    
    <p>I am looking forward to have the great Learning experience this Summer with RADIS :)</p>
