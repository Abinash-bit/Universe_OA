    Brief
    </h2>
    
    <p>Hello everyone this is Sri Guru Datta P.(pupperemeritus). I am extremely excited to get started with my GSoC journey. It has been a dream come true for me.</p>
    
    <p>Most of the progress in these weeks has been done on the fronts of</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Re-adjusting the proposed schedule : Re-evaluating and taking a closer look at requirements</li>
    <li>Gathering more information required to implement : Been provided reference implementation in MATLAB by Dr. Jeff Scargle himself. And validating the plan and research done during the period of creating the project proposal.</li>
    <li>Had weekly meets to break the ice and communicate more directly through weekly meets with mentors.</li>
    </ol>

    Environment setup
    </h2>
    
    <p>I had already completed my environment setup earlier in order to make pull requests to stingray. I just followed the documentation.<br />

    <h2>
    
    
    Codebase familiarity
    </h2>
    
    <p>I already had a bit of familiarity with powerspectrum, crossspectrum and bexvar modules as I had worked on various pull requests on them. My mentor advised me to look into multitaper, which I did. It gave me a few ideas on how I could implement this project.</p>
    
    <h2>
    
    
    Coding
    </h2>
    
    <p>I had already started a few days early and went ahead and implemented the Lomb-Scargle Fourier Transform which will be the backbone of the power spectrum and cross spectrum. 2 days into the coding period and I also have started coding up the wrapper classes. It turns out to be a very tangled process in order to get every small nook and cranny of the class to work. But I have seemed to get the hang of it.</p>
