    <p>&nbsp;I am having trouble allocating enough time to GSOC. I guess I am too tired after coming back from RRI and then going back. Also little things take too much time and eat up the time allocated for GSOC. I planned today's day quite well and will stick to my timetable to see how it goes.</p>
