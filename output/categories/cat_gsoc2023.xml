&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Brief
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone this is Sri Guru Datta P.(pupperemeritus). I am extremely excited to get started with my GSoC journey. It has been a dream come true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the progress in these weeks has been done on the fronts of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-adjusting the proposed schedule : Re-evaluating and taking a closer look at requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering more information required to implement : Been provided reference implementation in MATLAB by Dr. Jeff Scargle himself. And validating the plan and research done during the period of creating the project proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had weekly meets to break the ice and communicate more directly through weekly meets with mentors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Environment setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already completed my environment setup earlier in order to make pull requests to stingray. I just followed the documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.stingray.science/install.html"&gt;https://docs.stingray.science/install.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Codebase familiarity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had a bit of familiarity with powerspectrum, crossspectrum and bexvar modules as I had worked on various pull requests on them. My mentor advised me to look into multitaper, which I did. It gave me a few ideas on how I could implement this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Coding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already started a few days early and went ahead and implemented the Lomb-Scargle Fourier Transform which will be the backbone of the power spectrum and cross spectrum. 2 days into the coding period and I also have started coding up the wrapper classes. It turns out to be a very tangled process in order to get every small nook and cranny of the class to work. But I have seemed to get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/06/20230601_0311_pupperemeritus/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 02:11:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Utilising community bonding period Effectively!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230530_0000_1someshverma/</link><dc:creator>OpenAstronomy</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I started to contribute to RADIS from January’23 and whenever i needed help in some issue , mentors were quite helpful in providing revelant information to resolve that issue . And this thing helped me , to develop good bonding and understanding with the mentors .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So,I thought, i should use community bonding period more productively thus, i decided to work on project from 15 May .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In community bonding period i have done following things -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the RADIS and HITRAN Paper (selected parts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked on Loading the dataframe in Vaex format (task of first week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id="loading-dataframe-in-vaex-format"&gt;Loading Dataframe in Vaex format&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main functions which are used load databank in RADIS
These are :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fetch_databank()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;load_databank()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fetch_databank() : It is used to load databank from standard databank like HITRAN,HITEMP,EXOMOL,GEISA by fetching it from their respective APIs, then parsing and processing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;load_databank() : It is used to load databank from the local file or to load databank from user defined databank .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upto now, i have worked on fetch_databank() function to load dataframe in Vaex format , some of the things were already implemented while at other points i needed to write code specifically for vaex dataframe format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for load_databank() function , the hurdle was to parse it in vaex dataframe format as virual columns which are used in vaex dataframe to reduce memory use , it was throwing error . After trying many i finally found a fix for it .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have made necessary changes to these two functions to load dataframe in Vaex format. Next week i will be working on writing test cases for these.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>radis</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230530_0000_1someshverma/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting selected for GSoC’23@RADIS!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230524_0000_1someshverma/</link><dc:creator>OpenAstronomy</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I am Somesh Verma,a third year undergrad at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur. I have been accepted as contributor to the OpenAstronomy  RADIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="choosing-organisation"&gt;Choosing Organisation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  chose OpenAstronomy as i have interest in astronomy right from my childhood and RADIS also aline with my interst and skills .I have also contributed to Libre Health App for Baby Care but then i shifted my focus  only to RADIS . By the end i had four merged pull request and I was working on the fifth issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="contriutions-and-experience"&gt;Contriutions and Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to contribute to RADIS from January’23 , initially i faced problem to set up the things and run the code . After one weel or so I fixed the issues and than I spent one week on understanding the codebase ,reading documentation and try examples. By now , i had developed a rough understanding of the code .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then , I started to find issue over which i can work and started to work on the issues ,mentors have been quite helpful so far, whenever i got struck somewhere ,they helped in resolving the issue .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to have the great Learning experience this Summer with RADIS :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>radis</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230524_0000_1someshverma/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>I Got Selected As A GSoC student at SunPy!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230521_1158_exitflynn/</link><dc:creator>exitflynn</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-google-summer-of-code"&gt;What is The Google Summer of Code?
&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a program by Google for promoting students to contribute to open-source communities.
It is also a  G R E A T  opportunity for us to work on projects with such big impact. I’m so glad I came to know about it. I loved that I could get this opportunity to work with
Now one could argue that that’s the opportunity Open-Source provides in general, which is true. It’s difficult to admit but I did need that initial push, some motivating factor to &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; make the effort and get my hands wet with contributing to an open-source project. However it’s as they say, the beginning’s the hardest part and that once you start contributing it becomes so much more easy to keep going. I think they’ve done a great job at incentivising Open-Source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="choosing-an-org"&gt;Choosing an Org
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/tags/gsoc/index.xml#choosing-an-org"&gt;
&lt;svg height="100%" viewbox="0 0 28 23" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Organisations participate in GSoC. I had worked on a couple of #good-first-issues on a few projects before this period and had achieved that level of confidence where the language / tech-stack wasn’t the deciding factor for me anymore but it was now the project idea / the community.
I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; Astronomy and feel quite strongly about it. I am super-curious about how I can use my skills / to-be skills in tech in the field of Astronomy, some sort of an intersection of the two would actually be one of the most meaningful and enjoyable work I could find for myself.
Naturally, I looked into &lt;strong&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/strong&gt; as a GSoC org.
I’ve seen a lot of people prioritising those organisations which make for nicer addition to a resume from a product-based tech companies pov and it indeed &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a very smart way to go about it to be honest but I decided that I didn’t want to miss this unique opportunity to work on something I had wanted to do since a long time.
Under the sub-orgs for OpenAstronomy, I found &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="first-experience-with-sunpy"&gt;First Experience with SunPy
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/tags/gsoc/index.xml#first-experience-with-sunpy"&gt;
&lt;svg height="100%" viewbox="0 0 28 23" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, SunPy is a python library relating to solar physics. Though heliophysics wasn’t exactly something that I thought of when thinking of astrophysics or space-stuff, I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; impressed by how active and supportive the community is. Besides, I found myself interested in the networking side of things more than the solar-physics stuff anyways as for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While first going through the issues I came across one which included &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/6692"&gt;detecting gzipped files from more than just the extension&lt;/a&gt; (via file-signatures / magic-bytes). I love when my familairity with using linux-based systems comes into play during development and I felt the issue to be quite approachable. During the PR Review, I remember going through the documentation for python’s &lt;code&gt;gzip&lt;/code&gt; module to verify that it doesn’t need to decompress a whole gzipped file and that we could decompress just enough to get the first couple of bits which include the file-signature (since otherwise it’d mean way too much overhead for the solution to be practical) and information on that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as easily available on the web as I’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="subsequent-experience"&gt;Subsequent Experience
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/tags/gsoc/index.xml#subsequent-experience"&gt;
&lt;svg height="100%" viewbox="0 0 28 23" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept on making code-contributions which I felt approachable for some parts of January and February. And then I got a bit busy due to some health-reasons and college and organsing OSDHack ‘23 (I’ll totally write a blog-post on that later, it was such a nice success). I was a bit apprehensive because I was also looking forward to participate in the Google Summer of Code as a SunPy contributor and I didn’t want to give off the wrong impression so I wrote a (not)brief text to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nabobalis"&gt;Nabil&lt;/a&gt; who was super-supportive. When the proposal submission period came around, it wasn’t the most ideal process since I ended up having to make the proposal in the last 2 days. Thankfully again, the community is super responsive and I reached out to both Nabil and &lt;a href="https://github.com/wtbarnes"&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; for some feedback on my proposal and they both replied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contributing-to-open-source-is-goated"&gt;Contributing to Open-Source is GOATed
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/tags/gsoc/index.xml#contributing-to-open-source-is-goated"&gt;
&lt;svg height="100%" viewbox="0 0 28 23" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in tech / software development should actually be talking about this so much more than they are. Some of the things that come to my mind right now are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="its-a-great-way-to-learn-stuff"&gt;It’s a great way to learn stuff
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/tags/gsoc/index.xml#its-a-great-way-to-learn-stuff"&gt;
&lt;svg height="100%" viewbox="0 0 28 23" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main factors why I think people have a hard time contributing is that they think “I can’t contribute here because I don’t know nearly enough tech to do stuff”. The thing with being involved in this form of software development is that it gets you used to learning on the fly which is central to software development and doing well in any field, tbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to big open-source projects helped me gained TREMENDOUS self-confidence. I could look at any issue on any repo now, and never think that it’s un-doable. No matter what domain or what language the project is in, it’s only a question of how much time it’d take to get through the relevant documentation and concepts. This is certainly a long way from “I can’t do $#!+ in this codebase if my life depended on it, it scares me” and I’m very much glad I could have this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-best-practices-ever"&gt;The best practices ever

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get to learn how to write well-tested, well-documented and maintainable Production-Ready code following the best software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="you-get-to-choose-what-you-want-to-work-on"&gt;You get to choose what you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work on

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YEP! And most of the communities would love to have you work on it, that’s such an exciting thing if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. There are many institutions and individuals who write open software, mainly for research or free deployment purposes. Mostly these softwares, have only a few maintainers, and multiple people, writing and debugging the code, helps a lot. This is where Google Summer of Code &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;GSOC&lt;/code&gt; comes into the picture. It is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. Many organisations float projects for the developers to take over the summer and Google mediates in the process, while also paying the contributors for their work over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-gsoc-for-me"&gt;Why GSOC for me?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Science and Mathematics are two fields that I find to be most interesting. I first heard of Gsoc, when I was still finding my feet in the vast world of programming and computing. I was instantly sold to the idea of working for an organisation, and writing research code over summer. When I was searching for organisations and their project, I stumbled upon Open Astronomy, and in particular the project &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/gsoc2023/#/projects?project=searching_for_quasi-periodic_oscillations_with_gaussian_processes"&gt;Searching for Quasi-Periodic Oscillations with Gaussian Processes&lt;/a&gt;, for the Stingray Library. The QPO project was an exceptional opportunity that aligned perfectly with my interests and aspirations. Utilizing the Gaussian Process, a sophisticated and effective mathematical tool for regression and classification problems, the project analyzed astronomical data from some of the universe’s most extreme sources, including quasars and neutron stars - areas of particular interest to me. Given my programming expertise, the project’s requirements were an ideal match, and I was eager to undertake it as a learning experience. Over the course of a month, I worked diligently to secure the project, confident that it was the ideal fit for my skillset and passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="my-contribution-experience"&gt;My contribution experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My learnings from Gsoc began even before the project started. I had never worked on an open source package and the experience of making pull requests and getting them merged was very enriching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also add that through all this, my mentors helped me a lot in my project proposal as well as my code submissions. I would not have been able to make it this for without their help, and their patience in helping out with my amateur mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230507_0000_gaurav17joshi/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC - Pre Community Bonding</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2023/05/20230507_0000_labeeb-7z/</link><dc:creator>Labib Asari</dc:creator><description>&lt;h3 id="what-is-open-source-and-gsoc"&gt;What is Open-Source and Gsoc?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. There are many institutions and individuals who write open software, mainly for research or free deployment purposes. Mostly these softwares, have only a few maintainers, and multiple people, writing and debugging the code, helps a lot. This is where Google Summer of Code &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;GSOC&lt;/code&gt; comes into the picture. It is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. Many organisations float projects for the developers to take over the summer and Google mediates in the process, while also paying the contributors for their work over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
