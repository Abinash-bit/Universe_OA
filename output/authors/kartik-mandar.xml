I was eating from my PG mess and eating a lot from Zomato. I guess I ate something bad and had quite severe diarrhoea. I consulted a doctor online from practo and how lucky could I be to get a doctor who prescribed me so strong meds that they had side effects on me. Firstly I was dizzy throughout and quite tired. Then instead of loose stools, I stopped having stools altogether. It was a bruh! moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to go to a hospital and get some blood tests done because I went to some online consultation. For anyone reading this. Don't use practo man..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on my weekend was quite unproductive but I am much better today and will do my best to stay healthy from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/05/20240514_0724_kartikmandar/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 06:24:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Well much better now...</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/05/20240511_0612_kartikmandar/</link><dc:creator>Kartik Mandar</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt; I am able to allocate more time and can do this..yoo&lt;/p&gt;

I guess I am too tired after coming back from RRI and then going back. Also little things take too much time and eat up the time allocated for GSOC. I planned today's day quite well and will stick to my timetable to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

Was only able to give 2 hours to the project yesterday. Today I was much settled and was able to devote more time. I guess this is because Bangalore is a new city and it's taking time to get adjusted. But I have to manage time properly because for me it is the most precious thing. &lt;/p&gt;

It was a cool introduction. They are astrophysicists themselves. How cool is that! I am super excited to learn and work with them.&lt;/p&gt;

But today at 11:30 pm when I got the mail that my proposal was selected, my happiness knew no bounds. &lt;/p&gt;
