    <p>&nbsp;So 27th May was the first official day of GSOC when coding begins. I know I could have done more preparation but I am not too sad with the results. I was able to show my mentors a basic beginning of the layout. I am using the holoviz ecosystem to make the dashboard. The base is panel itself.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went through many of the tutorials and came to realise it is quite suitable to what we need from the dashboard.&nbsp;<br /><br />Doing this project is not say for example an extremely challenging or difficult problem/job. It's mostly a problem of consistency working on smaller issues and try to get hold of the bigger picture and be consistent in doing your work.<br /><br />I am excited to strive for the best and fulfil not only my mentors expectations but my own expectations with myself.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
