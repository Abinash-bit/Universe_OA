    <p>&nbsp;So I had recently shifted to Bangalore and this new pg and everything was quite new for me. I was eating from my PG mess and eating a lot from Zomato. I guess I ate something bad and had quite severe diarrhoea. I consulted a doctor online from practo and how lucky could I be to get a doctor who prescribed me so strong meds that they had side effects on me. Firstly I was dizzy throughout and quite tired. Then instead of loose stools, I stopped having stools altogether. It was a bruh! moment.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>So I had to go to a hospital and get some blood tests done because I went to some online consultation. For anyone reading this. Don't use practo man..</p>

    <p>Moving on my weekend was quite unproductive but I am much better today and will do my best to stay healthy from now on.</p>
