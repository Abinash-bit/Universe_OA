    <p>&nbsp;So I am not able to find out why panel has to serve multiple apps.&nbsp; Why can't I just serve single app and work from there and open any other python file from there. How would I get a app based architectures!&nbsp;<br />And I could make my files for particular functionalities.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also how could I get stateless behaviour from panel is also a challenge.&nbsp;</p>
