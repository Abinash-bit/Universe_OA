    <p>&nbsp;So to keep on top of my things and not procrastinate them away, I use beeminder to do the stuff.&nbsp;<br />Think of beeminder as a tool to keep you on your toes. So we can have any tasks on beeminder and it has all kinds of automations to connect with. So it doesn't do anything if you are completing the work, but if you are not doing your work on your scheduled pace then it stings you. So they charge you money from your bank account if you are not doing the work. I almost failed today but was able to complete the stuff in time to not get money deduct from me.<br /><br />But god it works. It's a really good tool to just stop procrastination. Because it costs you money.&nbsp;</p>
