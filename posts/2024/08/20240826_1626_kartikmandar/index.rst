    <p>&nbsp;Damn it was an eventful 3-4 months, from crying to why the code is not working to enjoying the small success of getting the plots. I am grateful that I got the opportunity to be in GSOC and get to know the wonderful mentors Matteo and Gullo. Thank you for guiding me. Let's see what the final term evaluation beholds for me..Fingers crossed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also regardless of how the evaluation turns out to be, I am gonna continue contributing to the project as much as I can.&nbsp;</p>
