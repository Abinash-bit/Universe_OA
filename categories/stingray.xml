I have done some reading to know what science is going behind stingray. Now comes the part of implementation. How do you connect everything in a dashboard and make it fluid and interactive. Of course there are tool and libraries for this, but the main question is how do you make this sustainable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holoviz is one of the options I am considering to go with!! Let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

I was eating from my PG mess and eating a lot from Zomato. I guess I ate something bad and had quite severe diarrhoea. I consulted a doctor online from practo and how lucky could I be to get a doctor who prescribed me so strong meds that they had side effects on me. Firstly I was dizzy throughout and quite tired. Then instead of loose stools, I stopped having stools altogether. It was a bruh! moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to go to a hospital and get some blood tests done because I went to some online consultation. For anyone reading this. Don't use practo man..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on my weekend was quite unproductive but I am much better today and will do my best to stay healthy from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/05/20240514_0724_kartikmandar/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 06:24:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Well much better now...</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/05/20240511_0612_kartikmandar/</link><dc:creator>Kartik Mandar</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt; I am able to allocate more time and can do this..yoo&lt;/p&gt;

I guess I am too tired after coming back from RRI and then going back. Also little things take too much time and eat up the time allocated for GSOC. I planned today's day quite well and will stick to my timetable to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

Was only able to give 2 hours to the project yesterday. Today I was much settled and was able to devote more time. I guess this is because Bangalore is a new city and it's taking time to get adjusted. But I have to manage time properly because for me it is the most precious thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the job has only started. There is so much to learn and do and what not.

&lt;p&gt;Both the Crosspectrum and Powerspectrum classes, the Lomb Scargle Fourier Transform and Basic Documentation have been completed. Tests are almost done too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have double checked with Matteo that the results are consistent using multiple examples and they are close to expected results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the documentation notebooks on how to use the classes.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out there wasn't that much of a problem in the algorithm. I just had to subtract the mean from the data before taking the fourier transform. The Lomb Scargle seems to work on data that has mean subtracted from it. Furthermore they dont seem to work that well or at all in full spectrum. &lt;br&gt;
The LSFT also is highly sensitive to the time intervals that are input to it. I have found some more clues as to how to make it even better. I will expound upon this further within 2 weeks since my final exams are going on and I have limited time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum Working Code Example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def data_func(time, freq=1.2324235252):
return  2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time * freq)

t0 = 0
t1 = 100
dt = 0.1

np.random.seed(43)
time_uniform = np.arange(t0, t1, dt)
time_nonuniform = np.sort(np.random.uniform(t0, t1, time_uniform.size))

npft = np.fft.fft(data_func(time_uniform))
npfreqs = np.fft.fftfreq(npft.size, dt)
npft = npft[npfreqs&amp;gt;=0]
npfreqs = npfreqs[npfreqs&amp;gt;=0]
lsfreqs = np.linspace(np.min(npfreqs), np.max(npfreqs), npfreqs.size * 8)
lsfreqs = lsfreqs[lsfreqs&amp;gt;=0]
np.random.seed(43)
lsft_slow_arr = lsft_slow(data_func(time_nonuniform), time_nonuniform, lsfreqs,sign=-1, fullspec=False)
lsft_fast_arr = lsft_fast(data_func(time_nonuniform), time_nonuniform, lsfreqs,sign=-1, fullspec=False,oversampling=10)
plt.plot(time_nonuniform,lsft_slow_inv(lsft_slow_arr,freqs=time_nonuniform, t=lsfreqs).real ,alpha=0.5,label="Slow")
plt.plot(time_nonuniform,lsft_fast_inv(lsft_fast_arr,freqs=time_nonuniform, t=lsfreqs).real,alpha=0.5,label="Fast")
plt.plot(time_nonuniform,data_func(time_nonuniform),label="Original Data")
plt.legend()
plt.xlim(0,10)
plt.ylim(-3,3)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Brief
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked on creating unit tests for the Lomb Scargle Cross Spectrum class, cross verifying the algorithm by comparing with the papers and fixed typos in docstrings. Apologies for the delay. Had my exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;


Details
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed a few faults in both the fast and the slow algorithms. I have gone back to the drawing board and tried to address those issues by following the papers as closely as possible. All the changes are visible in the following draft pull request.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/737"&gt;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fixing, the fast and the slow algorithm have started giving very similar outputs. I am starting to suspect that the time lags might be broken in the algorithms themselves. It is starting to get a little suspicious when different methods are giving very similar results and they are still not what that is expected. Last time around the fast and slow algorithms have given different results. After cross verifying with the papers, The results from both have fast and slow algorithms converged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the project sailing along while I wait for confirmation that this is an issue with the implementation or the algorithm , I have decided to work on writing unit tests for the various classes and methods. Furthermore I also worked on fixing the docstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
